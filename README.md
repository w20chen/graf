6. Maximum Flow (Edmonds-Karp)
7. Check the planarity of a simple graph (Demoucron-Malgrange-Pertuiset algorithm)
8. Cutting vertices (Tarjan's algorithm)
9. Dijkstra's algorithm
10. Prim's algorithm
11. Kruskal's algorithm
12. Bellman-Ford
13. Warshall-Floyd
14. SCC of a directed graph (Kosaraju's algorithm)
15. SCC of a directed graph (Tarjan's algorithm)
16. Johnson's algorithm

The question of 14 & 15 is shown below:     
Given a directed graph with n points and m edges, each point has a weight, find a path that maximizes the sum of the weights of the points that the path passes through. You only need to compute the weight sum.       
Multiple passes through an edge or point are allowed, but for repeated passes, the weight is only calculated once.
